# Unified Analytics Platform for Clinical Risk Forecasting and Operational Decision-Making

## Project Overview
This project builds a comprehensive analytics platform that integrates clinical and financial data for healthcare operations. It supports:
- Risk segmentation
- Readmission prediction
- Dashboard visualization
- Forecasting models for operational KPIs

## Structure
- `data/`: Sample dataset (clinical and financial)
- `notebooks/`: Step-by-step analysis and modeling Jupyter notebooks
- `src/`: Python modules for preprocessing, modeling, and visualization
- `dashboards/`: Dashboard designs and mockups (Power BI/Tableau)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Power BI/Tableau (designs)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies
2. Open the notebooks in sequence from `notebooks/`
3. Use `src/` functions to modularize your workflow
4. View dashboard ideas in `dashboards/dashboard_mockups.md`
